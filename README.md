# translatePythonAPI

## For development environment

- Example base site and development(<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-get-started-with-the-requests-library-in-python-pt>)
- Check and Update or Install Python3.
- Install PIP.
- translation test via post, one word at a time

## Instalando Python

Check if you already have Python installed, if you use GNU/Linux, you probably already have some version of Python installed by default. To check, type in a terminal:

```sh
which python
```

ou

```sh
which python3
```

Which should return something like `/usr/bin/python`. This means that Python is installed at that address.

Otherwise, if it returns something like which: `no python in (/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr...)` you need to install via the repositories or package manager of its distribution.

To install Python 3, type in a terminal:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3
```

To install the pip package manager, type in a terminal:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

## Install PIP from request

Install Python Requests

```sh
pip install requests
```
